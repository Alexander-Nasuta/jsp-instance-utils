# JSP Entropy Dataset 

The dataset by [Kemmerling et al.](https://preprints.inggrid.org/repository/view/21/) provides an important benchmark 
for job shop scheduling by explicitly addressing the diversity of jobs and operations using Shannon entropy. 
Unlike traditional datasets that rely on randomization or difficulty maximization, this dataset systematically varies 
instance diversity, making it particularly valuable for studying the impact of product mix on scheduling performance.
